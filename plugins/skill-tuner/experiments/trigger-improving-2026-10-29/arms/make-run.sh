# dir carries skill-creator's installed skill tree beside skill-tuner, so the two descriptions
# compete the way they do in the operator's harness. Approximation recorded in predeclare.md:
# here both are user skills; the harness serves skill-creator as a plugin skill.
#   arms:  live-cur (main's description) | live-imp (candidates/improving.SKILL.md)
#   tasks: imp | opt  (briefs/<task>.txt; no slash token, routing probes)
# Layout as the vet's: $R/cfg (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR), $R/bin/shipit, $R/work (cwd), $R/prompt.txt.
