"""Known-divergence tripwire against the agentskills.io reference validator.

skills/tune ships two frontmatter keys the spec's exhaustive field list
rejects: `argument-hint` and `disable-model-invocation`. They are kept
deliberately — both are functional on Claude Code and Cursor, tolerated by
Codex and VS Code, and no portable invocation-policy field exists to replace
them (decision record: PR #32 review thread and PR #38).

The check fails in two directions:

  - skills/tune is rejected for anything beyond exactly those two fields
    (we drifted further from the spec), or
  - skills/tune PASSES the validator (the spec or validator moved — e.g.
    agentskills/agentskills#350 `--allow-field` landed, or the frontmatter
    schema opened per discussion #211). That firing is good news: it means
    the divergence can likely be retired. Revisit the decision.

Requires the reference validator on PATH: `pip install skills-ref==0.1.1`.
Note the installed console command is named `agentskills`, not `skills-ref`
(the 0.1.1 wheel's entry point diverges from the project README).
