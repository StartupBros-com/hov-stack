"""Assert the shipped runner imports nothing but the standard library (R7).

R7 is a promise to adopters: the eval runner installs with the plugin and
runs on a bare machine, so `pip install` is never a prerequisite. Nothing was
enforcing it -- the constraint lived in a plan document and in the discipline
of whoever last edited the scripts, which is exactly the kind of rule that
holds until the first convenient afternoon.

This is a repo-maintenance tool. It is not part of the bundled skill, makes
no model calls, and imports only stdlib itself.
