Tune the document at `$ARGUMENTS`.

You are running the loop the human just asked for, so the runner may spend
tokens. Report the estimate before the first call and the actual after.

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` below is Claude Code's expansion for the plugin's
install root. In a client that does not expand it, resolve it yourself: the
plugin root is the directory three levels up from this SKILL.md — the one
that contains `skills/`. The command blocks below use `<target-path>` as a
slot, not a variable: replace it with the document path the human gave,
keeping the surrounding double quotes so a path with spaces stays one
argument. Never pass an unexpanded placeholder through to a shell.

## 1. Read it

Read `$ARGUMENTS` in full, and the bundled doctrine at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-tuner/SKILL.md`. You need both: the probe
tells you *what* is wrong, the doctrine tells you *what good looks like* when
you fix it.

## 2. Probe it

```
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-tuner/scripts/tune.py probe \
  --target "<target-path>" --run-id tune-$(date +%s) --yes --budget-usd 3 --verify-trials 3
```

Every finding it reports has already survived three independent skeptics in
fresh contexts, plus a code-level check that the quoted text genuinely appears
in the document. **Treat confirmed findings as real and act on them.** They are
not suggestions to evaluate; the evaluating already happened.

Read the run's `report.md` for each finding's quote and proposed fix.

Refuted findings are listed too, with the mode that killed them
(`verifier` = the rule did not apply; `quote_not_found` = the probe invented
its evidence). Treat refuted findings as closed: their one remaining job is
the report's refuted line, where the human sees what the probe got wrong.

## 3. Fix what it found

Apply each confirmed finding. The doctrine's rules are the target shape —
positive phrasing over prohibition, one trigger per branch, checkable
completion bounds, one meaning in one place.

Fix the defect, not the sentence containing it. A finding about a vague
completion bound is asking for a bound that can be checked, not for the word
"clearly" to be deleted.

Before each edit, one question: would a competent agent with the current
instructions still be expected to fail this way? If yes, there is a gap. If
no, defer — the text already required the behavior. When nothing clears that
bar, opening no change is the correct outcome, and the report says so per
finding; a speculative change is worse than none.

One check before acting: the skeptic panel verifies text against text — it
cannot see the filesystem. A finding that asserts an environment fact (a
path resolves, a file exists, a config value holds) needs that fact checked
on disk first. When the claim turns out false, the ambiguity that made the
text read as wrong is usually still real: fix that, not the false claim.

## 4. Re-probe

Run step 2 again against the edited file.

Done when **either** the re-probe confirms nothing, **or** it confirms only
findings disjoint from every earlier pass. A finding that overlaps an earlier
fix means that fix has not landed — address it and re-probe again; a fix that
trades one confirmed defect for another has not landed either.

Disjoint fresh findings at that point are the instrument's floor, not your
failure: the probe surfaces ~2 genuine defects per pass on almost any
document, including already-audited ones (its measured marginal-value
property), so a rich document never re-probes to zero — one loop here ran
eight passes before that was accepted. Apply the fresh ones that are cheap
and clearly right, and report the rest as residuals.

## 5. If you changed the description, prove it still routes

A reworded description is a routing change, and routing is the one thing here
that can be measured properly on a single document. Build a battery config
following `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/configs/receipts-routing-001-neutral.json`, with the original
description as `original` and yours as `pruned`, and keep its `"neutral_ids": true`: the
battery lists each skill's id beside its description, and an id routes on its own, so with
the id visible a parity verdict can be carried by the name rather than by the description
you are testing (the doctrine's routing-parity rule records the measurement). Then:

```
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/skill-tuner/scripts/tune.py routing-parity \
  --config <your-config> --run-id route-$(date +%s) --yes --budget-usd 3
```

Keep the new description only on a `land` verdict. On `refuse`, restore the
original and say which prompts it lost.

## What you may not claim

You probed one document. **A before/after count on one document is not
evidence of improvement** — this project has the receipts for that, having
recorded LOST, WON and WORSE for one question at n=1, 6 and 16 respectively.

So: report the defects you fixed and the routing verdict, both of which are
real. Do not report that the document is "better" as a measured fact, and do
not compare finding counts across the two probe runs as if the difference
meant something.

Measuring an actual improvement takes a paired comparison across many
documents — `tune.py compare`, which needs at least 3 and realistically many
more. Reach for it when changing something that affects a whole suite, such as
a shared convention or a doctrine, and never to grade a single edit.

## Report

- Confirmed defects found, and what you changed for each
- Anything refuted, so the human sees what the probe got wrong
- The routing verdict, if the description moved
- Actual spend, from the run output
