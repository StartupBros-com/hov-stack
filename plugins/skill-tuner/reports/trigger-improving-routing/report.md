## Routing-parity verdict

**Verdict: land**

- original: accuracy 49/52 (94.2%), near-miss rejection 32/32 (100.0%)
- pruned: accuracy 52/52 (100.0%), near-miss rejection 32/32 (100.0%)
- discordant trials: pruned lost 0, gained 3; exact two-sided p=0.250 — a refuse with p near 1 is indistinguishable from routing noise at this trial count
