### Confirmed findings

- **Single source of truth [craft]**: The same meaning (run the unit suite from skills/skill-tuner/scripts because tests import sibling modules by bare name) is restated almost verbatim in the Troubleshooting table row for ModuleNotFoundError ('Run `cd skills/skill-tuner/scripts` first; the tests import sibling modules by bare name.'). The doctrine requires each meaning live in one authoritative place so a behavior change is a one-place edit; the document itself demonstrates the correct alternative elsewhere ('The unit suite runs from `skills/skill-tuner/scripts` as shown under "Direct invocation"' in the Test section), showing the duplication here was avoidable.
  - quote: "Run **from that directory** — the tests import sibling modules by bare name."
  - proposed fix: Replace the Troubleshooting row's explanation with a cross-reference, e.g. 'Run from `skills/skill-tuner/scripts` — see "Direct invocation" above.' instead of restating the sibling-import rationale.
