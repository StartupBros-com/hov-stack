### Confirmed findings

- **Co-location [craft] — keep a concept's definition, rules, and caveats under one heading, so reading one part brings its neighbours. Spot it by asking whether applying a rule correctly requires having read a different section.**: This is the canonical usage example for `verify`, but the fact that a normal DRIFTED result exits 1 — and that a wrapper must treat 'produced a verdict' as success — is stated only later, in the Gotchas section. An agent that copies this example into a script (e.g. under `set -e`, or checking `$?` / `&&`) would treat a healthy DRIFTED verdict as a crash, which is exactly the misinterpretation the Gotchas bullet warns against. Correctly using the command shown here requires having already read a different, non-adjacent section.
  - quote: "Judge two banked runs, or re-check one for drift — both free:

```bash
python3 skills/skill-tuner/scripts/tune.py compare \
  --baseline swapgate3-probe-incumbent \
  --candidate swapgate5-probe-doctrine-v2 --exclude design-drift

python3 skills/skill-tuner/scripts/tune.py verify swapgate5-probe-doctrine-v2
```"
  - proposed fix: Add the exit-code caveat right at the point of use, e.g. append '`verify` exits 1 on DRIFTED — that is a verdict, not a failure; treat any verdict as success' immediately after the verify example in Direct invocation, instead of leaving it only in Gotchas.
